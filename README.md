# Book_files
This program performs various operations (described below) on book records stored using a circular linked-list and files.  
- Find all records with a particular year and store them in a file for that year (i.e 2018.txt)
- Delete all consecutive repeated records
- Create another circular list for all the records by a specific author
- Add few records to the list based on given requirements (i.e. add in between two records, etc.)
- Rearrange some records by swapping them
- Finally commit the changes by recording the contents of the linked list in a new file.
